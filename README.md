# stys-for-overleaf

Provide missing sty files for overleaf.

Overleaf is based on TeX Live 2016 and does not offer recent packages.
They have a FAQ [What packages do you support?](https://www.overleaf.com/help/30-what-packages-do-you-support), which contained the hitn to email them.
This hint was removed and they want to keep their system consistent and stable.
Thus, users have to upload missing `sty` files manually.
However, not all package authors offer the compiled `sty` file, but only the source files of that sty files.
Although all [texlive packages are available online](http://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive/), they are archived and one cannot directly download the `sty` files.

Hence, this repository offers quick access to required `sty` files.
