> Missing `.sty` / `.cls` files for overleaf.

[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is [based on TeX Live 2021](https://de.overleaf.com/blog/tex-live-2021-now-available) as of end of October 2021.
New packages after that update are not offered automatically.
As a result, recent packages available on [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/) (and thus in [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) and [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/)) are not available as default.

They have a FAQ [What packages do you support?](https://www.overleaf.com/help/30-what-packages-do-you-support), which asks the users to upload `sty` files for themselves (to keep their system consistent and stable).
Thus, users have to upload missing `sty` files manually.
However, not all package authors offer the compiled `sty` file, but only the source files of that sty files.
Although all [texlive packages are available online](http://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive/), they are archived and one cannot directly download the `sty` files.

Hence, this repository offers quick access to required `cls`/`sty` files.
